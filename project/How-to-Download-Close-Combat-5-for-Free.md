## Some Tips and Tricks for Playing Close Combat 5
 
Now that you have downloaded and installed Close Combat 5 for free, you might want to know some tips and tricks to improve your gameplay. Here are some of them:
 
- Use the pause button. Close Combat 5 is a real-time strategy game, but you can pause it at any time to issue orders to your units. This can help you plan your moves better and react to changing situations.
- Use cover and concealment. Your units can take advantage of the terrain and buildings to hide from enemy fire or ambush them. You can also use smoke grenades, artillery barrages, or air strikes to create cover or distract the enemy.
- Use combined arms. Your units have different strengths and weaknesses, so you need to use them together to achieve the best results. For example, infantry can capture objectives and clear buildings, but they are vulnerable to tanks and machine guns. Tanks can destroy enemy vehicles and fortifications, but they are vulnerable to anti-tank weapons and mines. Machine guns can suppress enemy infantry, but they are vulnerable to snipers and mortars.
- Use morale and fatigue. Your units have morale and fatigue levels that affect their performance. Morale depends on factors such as casualties, leadership, experience, and proximity to friendly units. Fatigue depends on factors such as movement, combat, weather, and supply. You need to keep an eye on these levels and manage them accordingly. For example, you can use rally points, medics, or reinforcements to boost morale, or you can use rest points, supply trucks, or retreats to reduce fatigue.
- Use the editor. Close Combat 5 comes with a powerful editor that allows you to create your own scenarios, maps, units, weapons, and more. You can also download and play user-made content from the internet. This way, you can enjoy endless possibilities and replay value.
